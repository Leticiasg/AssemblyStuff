AssemblyStuff
=============

There are assembly stuff here.

The folder AssemblerIAS contains an assembler that I made for the IAS Archtecture.

The folder ARMutils contais some implementations that I made for ARMv5 Archtecture. 
This folder contais:
  
  + Printf with syscall implementation
  + Scanf with syscall implementation

Feel free to change the code and fix bugs
